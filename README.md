# Synopsis Fishing Game 

In the game, players find themselves at Loch Corraillí, a mystical lake home to the legendary creature, An Phiast. The player casts their fishing line into the water, waiting patiently for a bite. Once they get a nibble, they must click quickly to hook the fish. Players use the scroll wheel to carefully reel in their catch, making sure they don’t reel too fast or slow. 

An Phiast, the guardian of the lake, always demands a tribute. After reeling in a fish, the player offers it to An Phiast, who devours the catch in exchange for rewards. These rewards range from enchanted lures to stronger fishing lines, which help the player capture rarer and more valuable fish hiding deep within the loch. Over time, players get the best gear where then they have a chance to catch the rarest fish in Loch Corraillí’s waters completing the game.
